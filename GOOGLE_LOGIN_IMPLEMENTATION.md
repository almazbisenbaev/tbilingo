# Google Login Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Google Sign-In authentication for Tbilingo app using Firebase Authentication.

## Changes Made

### 1. AuthContext (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Added `GoogleAuthProvider` and `signInWithPopup` imports from Firebase Auth
- Created `loginWithGoogle()` method that:
  - Creates a Google Auth Provider instance
  - Opens a popup for Google authentication
  - Handles the sign-in flow
- Added `loginWithGoogle` to the AuthContext interface and value export

### 2. LoginPage (`src/components/LoginPage.tsx`)
- Added `loginWithGoogle` from useAuth hook
- Created `handleGoogleSignIn()` function with error handling for:
  - Popup closed by user
  - Popup blocked by browser
  - General authentication errors
- Added "Continue with Google" button with official Google colors/branding
- Added visual divider ("or") between email login and Google login
- Added CSS styles for:
  - `.btn-google` - Google button styling
  - `.auth-divider` - Separator between auth methods
  - `.google-icon` - Google logo icon

### 3. SignupPage (`src/components/SignupPage.tsx`)
- Added `loginWithGoogle` from useAuth hook
- Created `handleGoogleSignIn()` function (same implementation as LoginPage)
- Added "Continue with Google" button
- Added visual divider ("or") between email signup and Google login
- Added same CSS styles as LoginPage

### 4. WelcomeScreen (`src/components/auth/WelcomeScreen.tsx`)
- Added useState for error and loading states
- Added `loginWithGoogle` from useAuth hook
- Created `handleGoogleSignIn()` function
- Made Google Sign-In the primary CTA button (top position)
- Modified existing buttons to "Sign Up with Email" and "Sign In with Email"
- Added error message display
- Added visual divider between Google and email options

### 5. Global Styles (`src/app/globals.css`)
- Added `.btn-google` styles with:
  - White background with border
  - Hover effects (shadow, border color change, slight lift)
  - Disabled state styling
- Added `.auth-divider` styles for "or" separator
- Added `.error-message` styles for error display
- Added `.google-icon` helper class

## User Flow

### New User:
1. User sees WelcomeScreen with "Continue with Google" as primary option
2. Clicks Google button → Google sign-in popup opens
3. Selects Google account → Automatically signed in and redirected to app
4. Alternatively: Can click "Sign Up with Email" for traditional flow

### Returning User:
1. Can use "Continue with Google" from WelcomeScreen
2. Can click "Sign In with Email" and use Google login from LoginPage
3. Both paths work seamlessly

## Error Handling
All Google login implementations handle:
- **Popup blocked**: Informs user to enable popups
- **User cancelled**: Shows "Sign-in cancelled" message
- **Generic errors**: Falls back to friendly error message
- All errors are displayed in styled error message boxes

## Design Considerations
- Google button uses official Google brand colors and icon
- Consistent UI across all auth screens
- Clear visual hierarchy with dividers
- Disabled states during loading
- Responsive and mobile-friendly

## Testing Checklist
- ✅ Google login works from WelcomeScreen
- ✅ Google login works from LoginPage
- ✅ Google login works from SignupPage
- ✅ Error handling for popup blocked
- ✅ Error handling for user cancellation
- ✅ Loading states work correctly
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Consistent styling across all screens

## Firebase Configuration
Google Auth Provider must be enabled in Firebase Console:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method
2. Enable Google provider
3. Configure OAuth consent screen if needed

## Notes
- Uses `signInWithPopup` which works well for web applications
- For mobile apps, consider `signInWithRedirect` as an alternative
- User data is automatically synced with Firebase Auth
- Display name and profile photo from Google account are preserved
